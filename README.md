# Logistic Regression with Feature Scaling

This project explores how different feature scaling techniques (Min-Max Normalization and Standardization) affect the performance of **Logistic Regression** on a classification dataset using `sklearn`.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Train Logistic Regression on raw, normalized, and standardized data.
- Compare accuracies across different scaling methods.
- Visualize feature distributions before and after scaling.
- Answer key analytical questions related to scaling and model behavior.
